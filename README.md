## Description
it's important to have a command-line application that generates a professional README file for a new project, based on user input. This README file is built using Node.js, and utilises the Inquirer library to prompt the user with questions about the project. The user provides information, e.g. project title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, test intructions, chosen license, Github username and email address.

The README generator includes the following main functions:
- getLicenseBadgeURL(License)
- generateREADME(answers)
- Inquirer Prompts
- File Writing

Benefits and Usefulness:
- Time-Saving: It saves developers from manually writing the same content for each new project
- Consistency: The README format & structure remain consistent across different projects
- Professional Look: The generators ensures that essential information e.g. description, installation, usage etc, is included in the README.
- Ease of Use: With simple prompts, it makes it user-friendly and accessible to developers
- License Management: By providing license options & automatically adding license badges, it helps developers comply with open-source licensing requirements.
- Documentation: Crucial for effective project documentation, it encourages developers to provide essential details about the project.
- Consolidated Information: all the info about the project is centralised in one place, making easier for developers to find and access vital project details.
- Community Engagement: A well maintained README attracts potential contributors and users by providing clear instructions on how to use, contribute and contact the project's maintainers.

This application has not been deployed, therefore, I have provided a [README Generator Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l07XSCTBMcY&ab_channel=KalidNadere), that demonstrates its functionality:



The application will be invoked by running the following command:
- node index.js
